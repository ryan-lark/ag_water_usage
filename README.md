## U.S. IRRIGATED CROP WATER USAGE MAP:
This map compares water usage by county for crop irrigation in the United States over time at 5 year increments (2005, 2010, 2015). The time element denotes changes in consumption over a ten year period. All data is given in mega-gallons per day. Since data is not available for all counties in the U.S., only those with reported data are colored.

QGIS was used to cut down the datafile and store it as a CSV. Leaflet and Papa Parse was used from the JavaScript Library. Leaflet was also used to add the UI element to the map. 

An HTML, CSS, and JS file was used, and the map is currently being hosted on GitHub pages.
